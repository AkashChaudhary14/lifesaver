        <h2 class="title">Free health checkup</h2>
        <hr />
        <p>
            In order to give blood, you're required to undergo a health screening.
            A trained staff member performs this checkup. They'll check your:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>pulse</li>
            <li>blood pressure</li>
            <li>body temperature</li>
            <li>hemoglobin levels</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            This free mini-physical can offer excellent insight into your health.
            It can effectively detect problems that could indicate an underlying
            medical condition or risk factors for certain diseases.
        </p>

        <p>Your blood is also tested for several diseases. These include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>hepatitis B</li>
            <li>hepatitis C</li>
            <li>HIV</li>
            <li>West Nile virus</li>
            <li>syphilis</li>
            <li>Trypanosoma cruzi</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="title">Side effects of donating blood</h2>
        <hr />
        <p>
            Blood donation is safe for healthy adults. There's no risk of
            contracting disease. New, sterile equipment is used for each donor.
            <br /><br />
            Some people may feel nauseous, lightheaded, or dizzy after donating
            blood. If this happens, it should only last a few minutes. You can lie
            down with your feet up at the until you feel better.
            <br /><br />
            You may also experience some bleeding at the site of the needle.
            Applying pressure and raising your arm for a couple of minutes will
            usually stop this. You may develop a bruise at the site.
            <br />
            Call the blood donation center if:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                You still feel lightheaded, dizzy, or nauseous after drinking,
                eating, and resting.
            </li>
            <li>
                You develop a raised bump or continue bleeding at the needle site.
            </li>
            <li>You have arm pain, numbness, or tingling.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="title">During the donation</h2>
        <hr />
        <p>
            You must register to donate blood. This includes providing
            identification, your medical history, and undergoing a quick physical
            examination. You'll also be given some information about blood
            donation to read. <br /><br />
            Once you're ready, your blood donation procedure will begin. Whole
            blood donation is the most common type of donation. This is because it
            offers the most flexibility. It can be transfused as whole blood or
            separated into red cells, platelets, and plasma for different
            recipients.
            <br /><br />
            For a whole blood donation procedure:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                You'll be seated in a reclining chair. You can donate blood either
                sitting or lying down.
            </li>
            <li>
                A small area of your arm will be cleaned. A sterile needle will then
                be inserted.
            </li>
            <li>
                You'll remain seated or lying down while a pint of your blood is
                drawn. This takes 8 to 10 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                When a pint of blood has been collected, a staff member will remove
                the needle and bandage your arm.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Other types of donation include:
            <br />
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>platelet donation (plateletpheresis)</li>
            <li>plasma donation (plasmapheresis)</li>
            <li>double red cell donation</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            These types of donations are performed using a process called
            apheresis. An apheresis machine is connected to both of your arms. It
            collects a small amount of blood and separates the components before
            returning the unused components back to you. This cycle is repeated
            several times over approximately two hours. <br /><br />
            Once your donation is complete, you'll be given a snack and a drink
            and be able to sit and rest for 10 or 15 minutes before you leave. If
            you feel faint or nauseous, you'll be able to lie down until you feel
            better.
        </p>

        <h2 class="title">What to know before you donate</h2>
        <hr />
        <p>Here are some important things to know before you donate:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                You need to be 17 or older to donate whole blood. Some states allow
                you to donate at 16 with parental consent.
            </li>
            <li>
                You have to weigh at least 110 pounds and be in good health to
                donate.
            </li>
            <li>
                You need to provide information about medical conditions and any
                medications you're taking. These may affect your eligibility to
                donate blood.
            </li>
            <li>
                You must wait at least 8 weeks between whole blood donations and 16
                weeks between double red cell donations.
            </li>
            <li>
                Platelet donations can be made every 7 days, up to 24 times per
                year.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The following are some suggestions to help you prepare for donating
            blood:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Drink an extra 16 ounces of water before your appointment.</li>
            <li>Eat a healthy meal that's low in fat.</li>
            <li>
                Wear a short-sleeved shirt or a shirt with sleeves that are easy to
                roll up.
            </li>
        </ul>
